# Package Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions for installing all required Python packages for the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- pip package manager

## Quick Installation

To install all required packages at once:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib gymnasium tqdm
```

## Individual Package Installation

If you prefer to install packages individually:

```bash
# Core scientific packages
pip install numpy        # For numerical computations
pip install matplotlib   # For plotting and visualization

# Machine Learning packages
pip install gymnasium    # For reinforcement learning environments

# Utilities
pip install tqdm        # For progress bars
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure Python and pip are up to date
2. Try upgrading pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
3. If a package installation fails, try installing it individually

For additional help, consult the official documentation for each package.
